  title: 'Neuroticism',
  shortDescription: 'Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings.',
  description: `Freud originally used the term neurosis to describe a
condition marked by mental distress, emotional suffering, and an
inability to cope effectively with the normal demands of life. He
suggested that everyone shows some signs of neurosis, but that we
differ in our degree of suffering and our specific symptoms of
distress. Today neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience
negative feelings. <br /><br />Those who score high on Neuroticism may
experience primarily one specific negative feeling such as anxiety,
anger, or depression, but are likely to experience several of these
emotions. <br /><br />People high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive. They
respond emotionally to events that would not affect most people, and
their reactions tend to be more intense than normal. They are more
likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor
frustrations as hopelessly difficult. <br /><br />Their negative emotional
reactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time, which
means they are often in a bad mood. These problems in emotional
regulation can diminish a neurotic's ability to think clearly, make
decisions, and cope effectively with stress.`,

      text: `The "fight-or-flight" system of the brain of anxious
individuals is too easily and too often engaged. Therefore, people who
are high in anxiety often feel like something dangerous is about to happen.
They may be afraid of specific situations or be just generally fearful.
They feel tense, jittery, and nervous. Persons low in Anxiety are generally
calm and fearless.`

impression that everyone is watching and judging them. They do not feel
