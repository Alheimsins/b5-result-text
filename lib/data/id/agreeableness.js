  title: 'Agreeableness',
  shortDescription: 'Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.',
  description: `They are therefore considerate, friendly,
generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with
others'. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human
nature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and
trustworthy. <br /><br />
Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with
others.  They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and
therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people.
Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be
suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.
<br /><br />
Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining
popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable
people. On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations
that require tough or absolute objective decisions. Disagreeable
people can make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.`,

are fair, honest, and have good intentions. Persons low in trust

      title: 'Morality',
      text: `High scorers on this scale see no need for
pretense or manipulation when dealing with others and are therefore
candid, frank, and sincere. Low scorers believe that a certain
amount of deception in social relationships is necessary. People
find it relatively easy to relate to the straightforward
high-scorers on this scale. They generally find it more difficult
to relate to the unstraightforward low-scorers on this scale. It
should be made clear that low scorers are not unprincipled
or immoral; they are simply more guarded and less willing to openly
reveal the whole truth.`

      text: `Altruistic people find helping other people
genuinely rewarding. Consequently, they are generally willing to
assist those who are in need. Altruistic people find that doing
things for others is a form of self-fulfillment rather than
self-sacrifice. Low scorers on this scale do not particularly like
helping those in need. Requests for help feel like an imposition
rather than an opportunity for self-fulfillment.`

      text: `Individuals who score high on this scale
dislike confrontations. They are perfectly willing to compromise or
to deny their own needs in order to get along with others. Those

      text: `High scorers on this scale do not like to claim
that they are better than other people. In some cases this attitude
may derive from low self-confidence or self-esteem. Nonetheless,
some people with high self-esteem find immodesty unseemly. Those
who are willing to describe themselves as superior tend to
be seen as disagreeably arrogant by other people.`

tenderhearted and compassionate. They feel the pain of others
vicariously and are easily moved to pity. Low scorers are not
affected strongly by human suffering. They pride themselves on
making objective judgments based on reason. They are more concerned
with truth and impartial justice than with mercy.`
