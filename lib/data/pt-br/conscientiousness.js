  title: 'Conscientiousness',
  shortDescription: 'Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses.',
  description: `Impulses are not inherently bad;
occasionally time constraints require a snap decision, and acting on
our first impulse can be an effective response. Also, in times of
play rather than work, acting spontaneously and impulsively can be
fun. Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful,
fun-to-be-with, and zany.
<br /><br />
Nonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of
ways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts
not only harm other members of society, but also can result in
retribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another
problem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate
rewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include
excessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job,
hurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important
relationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually
destroy one's health.
<br /><br />
Impulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes
a person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively
disallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which
would have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also
sidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences
of steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are
therefore small, scattered, and inconsistent.
<br /><br />
A hallmark of intelligence, what potentially separates human beings
from earlier life forms, is the ability to think about future
consequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity
involves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning
routes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face
of short-lived impulses to the contrary. The idea that intelligence
involves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence, an
alternative label for the Conscientiousness domain. Prudent means
both wise and cautious.
<br /><br/>
Persons who score high on the
Conscientiousness scale are, in fact, perceived by others as intelligent.
The benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious. Conscientious
individuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through
purposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively
regarded by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative
side, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics.
Furthermore, extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded
as stuffy and boring.
<br /><br />
Unconscientious people may be criticized for
their unreliability, lack of ambition, and failure to stay within
the lines, but they will experience many short-lived pleasures and
they will never be called stuffy.`,
