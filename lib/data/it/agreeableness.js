  title: 'Agreeableness',
  shortDescription: 'Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.',
  description: `They are therefore considerate, friendly,
generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with
others'. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human
nature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and
trustworthy. <br /><br />
Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with
others.  They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and
therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people.
Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be
suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.
<br /><br />
Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining
popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable
people. On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations
that require tough or absolute objective decisions. Disagreeable
people can make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.`,

      title: 'Morality',
      text: `High scorers on this scale see no need for
pretense or manipulation when dealing with others and are therefore
candid, frank, and sincere. Low scorers believe that a certain
amount of deception in social relationships is necessary. People
find it relatively easy to relate to the straightforward
high-scorers on this scale. They generally find it more difficult
to relate to the unstraightforward low-scorers on this scale. It
should be made clear that low scorers are not unprincipled
or immoral; they are simply more guarded and less willing to openly
reveal the whole truth.`

      Conseguentemente, loro sono generalmente predisposti ad aiutare chi ne ha di bisogno. Le persone altruistiche trovano che fare cose per gli altri è una forma di autorealizzazione
      pittosto che un sacrificio. Chi ha un basso punteggio non ama particolarmente aiutare chi ha bisogno. 
      Pensano che le richieste di aiuto siano come una imposizione piuttosto che una opportunità di rendersi utili.`

some people with high self-esteem find immodesty unseemly. Those

with truth and impartial justice than with mercy.`
