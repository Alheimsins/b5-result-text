  title: 'Nevrosi',
  shortDescription: 'Il termine Nevrosi si riferisce alla tendente costanza di provare sentimenti negativi.', 
  description: `In origine Freud era solito usare il termine nevrosi 
per descrivere una condizione marcata da stress mentale, sofferenza 
emozionale, e l’inabilità a far fronte alle normali richieste della vita. 
Egli supponeva che chiunque mostri segni di nevrosi, ma che questi 
differiscono in base al nostro grado di sofferenza e ai nostri specifici 
sintomi di angoscia. Oggi il termine Nevrosi si riferisca alla tendenza 
a sperimentare sentimenti negativi. <br /><br />Coloro che ottengono punteggi 
alti in Nevrosi potrebbero sperimentare principalmente un sentimento negativo 
come ansia, rabbia, o depressione, ma sono soliti provare diverse 
di queste emozioni. <br /><br /> Gli individui alti in nevrosi sono 
emotivamente reattivi. Rispondono emotivamente ad eventi che non influenzerebbero 
la maggior parte delle persone e le loro reazioni tendono ad essere più intense 
del normale. Essi tendono ad interpretare situazioni ordinarie come 
minacciose, e minori frustrazioni come difficoltà senza speranze. <br /><br /> 
Le loro reazioni emotivamente negative rendono a persistere per lunghi ed 
anormali periodi di tempo, il che risulta in un costante malumore. Questi 
problemi di regolazione emotiva possono diminuire l’abilità nevrotica di 
pensare chiaramente, prendere decisioni e far fronte allo stress.`,
